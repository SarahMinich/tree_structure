# the tile i and if the last tile assigned to it was j

# with the tile [N1, N2, N5, N11] already assigned. A more detailled explanation is given in the

# In this version of the FPTAS, the state has four members :
# a : completion time on M1
# b : completion time on M2
# k : index of the other last assigned tile on one of the machine. There are two 'last' tiles
#       (the ones on 'top' of M1 and M2) and one of them is i - 1. The other one is k.
# alpha : boolean which says if the tile i - 1 was assigned to M1 or to M2
# The four possible situations are :
# 
#  |_______|     |       |          |_______|     |_______|
#  |___i___|     |_______|          |___i___|     |__i-1__|

    # the first colomn should be interpreted as follows: if nothing has been scheduled on the machine, how
    # many symbols should I add to the machine to be able to assign the tile number i (with i a row number). Of
    # course this number equals the size of the tile.
    # Then, the rest of the matrix is used as usual : M[i][j] = number of symbols I must add to a machine if the
    # last scheduled tile is j and if I want to add the tile i.

    # There will be empty cells for two reasons : 
    #       - There is a condition inherent to the method which is i >= j. So this means half of the matrix is empty
